# Banking-System
Python project that outputs calculated data to the terminal. (Written in Python)

I created the first level of authentication (Username and Password) with conditional statements nested in a while-loop.

Then made the second level which requires a pin number with the in range function.

The account object runs after the two levels of authentication and holds different functions which
initialize the account object, creates the account balance that the program will calculate from, makes
the deposit object that adds to the current balance, shows an insufficient funds message if the amount being
withdrawn is greater than the current account balance, and the last function is a view balance option that prints
the value that is currently available.

Finally I made the 'transaction' and 'Another transaction' objects which give you multiple attempts to deposit, withdraw, or view the current balance
in the program.
